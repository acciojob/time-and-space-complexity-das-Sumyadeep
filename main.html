	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input and makes it efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of space taken to execute the program. The linear space complexity becomes O(n). </p>
