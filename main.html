	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input and makes it efficient.</p>
	<p>The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>Space Complexity</b> of the algorithm. The linear space complexity becomes O(n). </p>
